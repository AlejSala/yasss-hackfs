```//"Token Metadata JSON Schema": a Standard for Smart Contract Interoperability across chains with richer Metadata.
**Value of a Token -beyond: price! there is much more to Creator Value than Asset Price!**

- (i) Proof of Value [PoV]
- (ii) Token Provenance from DoM [Day of Mint]  
- (iii) Append Value to NFTs: Incremental Life Time Value [LTV] 

Proposed **"Additional"** Transaction Hash Method Categories/Attributes. Searchable by Address/Txn Hash/ Block/ Ens and included in Token Metadata JSON Schema. 
- [ ]  NFT accrete-Value Blockchain Provenance
    - [ ]  Blockchain Transaction Hash Methods: as Engagement NFTCreator < â€” > Peer/NFTNewOwner&UseWhileOwner
        - [ ]  Mint
        - [ ]  Exhibit (e.g. ArtBasel NoGallery DAO First NFT Experience [Exhibit/VR/AR])
        - [ ]  Mutate (e.g Async NFTOwner set of Creator approved edits, Async NFTCreator change access to NFTOwner's NFT)
        - [ ]  Access
        - [ ]  Attend
        - [ ]  Participate
        - [ ]  Win
        - [ ]  Vote
